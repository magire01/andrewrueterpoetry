simulation of fame\\nIf I can ignore the shame\\n\\nThe tread is wearing off the tire\\nAfter the internet stripped\\nThe rubber off the telephone wire\\nAnd we lost our loose grip\\nAfter being shocked\\nBy the rest of the flock\\nTheir existence\\nShows a difference\\nThat is hard to accept\\nWe\'re not what we expect\\n\\nWe push the boundaries of communication\\nBut we can\'t handle the technology\\nI feel it gives me social immunization\\nBut I feel the darkness follow me\\n\\nAnd swallow me\\nUntil I\'m wallowing\\nYet I don\'t know why\\nI try to ignore it\\nOnly if it gets me high\\nWill I be for it\\n\\nThis utilitarian keyboard\\nShould help me see more\\nInstead it transcribes my anger\\nAs I turn into an electric stranger\\nThe words on my pixelated screen\\nDo not reflect my childhood dreams\\nBut the bitterness of dreams being crushed\\nMy petulant reactions are thoughtlessly rushed\\nAnd I represent my views in a negative way\\nUntil I\'d be more useful with nothing to say\\n\\nThere is a need for empathy\\nIn the electronic discourse\\nRight now there is only entropy\\nAnd words without remorse\\nSpoken from a high horse\\nThat looks down on peasants who own it\\nIt\'s also a slave but doesn\'t even know it\\n\\nSo it arrogantly trots along\\nNever admitting that it\'s wrong\\nUntil it hears the slithering snakes rattle\\nThen it doesn\'t mind wearing a saddle\\nBut the venom has already been injected\\nAnd its mind becomes hopelessly infected\\n\\nWe argue without blinking\\nWe argue without thinking\\nWe argue with poor logic\\nOur ignorance we flaunt it\\nUntil the internet is haunted"},{"id":1,"title":"Art and Religion","datePosted":"May 2019","addInfo":"This poem is about communism","text":"Can art and religion coexist\\nwhen art is about

The message of the movie is somewhat ironic and tongue-in-cheek. None of the characters are liekable but they are broadly relatable in the sense that we all have things that make us different that might be looked down on yet we should still feel pride and dignity.","relatabilityScore":"2/10","execution":"the lack of budget is apparent in the filmmaking but Waters did a good job of embracing that by using it to serve the aesthetic and subject matter. You can see a clear influence on later great low budget films like Gummo and Tangerine. The acting is bad but that adds to the quirky offbeat quality of the movie. The cinematography is appealingly trashy and some of the visuals are hauntingly disturbing in a disgusting manner.","executionScore":"8/10","context":"pretty funny little story regarding a fight for superiority. Like a disgusting Hatfields and McCoys. The plot is merely a framework to hang weird and gross shit on and it accomplished that.","contextScore":"8/10","subtext":"kind of interesting movie. I know in the trans community an egg refers to someone who hasn\'t realized they\'re trans yet but it can also more broadly mean someone who hasn\'t come out of their shell. The grandmother loves eggs and eats them in a gluttonous manner in her crib. So she\'s a fat baby who married an egg man. Seems like there might be something there, probably just to say Divine\'s family wasn\'t supportive, which seems apparent through her actions. Otherwise Divine\'s ideology seems like an embracement of the criticisms society might have for her more natural inclinations. Like society calls her disgusting so she gets back at it by showing them how disgusting it can get. Divine killing the other filthy people and the police seemed like a statement on her individuality and agency.","subtextScore":"7/10","emotion":"if you have a weak stomach for gross or sexual content I would highly recommend not watching this film. If you\'re into watching the weirdest most fucked up shit you can find this is a must watch. Very disturbing and grotesque content that had a shocking and haunting effect. The range of emotions is limited to comedy and nastiness but delivers heavily in those categories.","emotionScore":"6.5/10","overAllRating":"58","song":"Freak Like Me -
